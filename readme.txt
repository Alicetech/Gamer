Welcome to the DIY Gamer Arduino library

This library enables you to easily control the DIY Gamer kit
and make awesome minimal games, pixel by pixel.

INSTALLING
==========

1. Use the Download ZIP button to grab the Gamer library.
2. Unzip the contents into your Arduino libraries folder (Documents/Arduino/libraries on OSX, My Documents\Arduino\libraries on Windows or ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries (or similar) on Linux)

TESTING
=======

The easiest way to test is the library has been successfully installed for Arduino is to run one of the examples from within the Arduino program. Go to File > Examples > Gamer and choose one of the examples. Use the Verify button in Arduino to compile the example. If it compiles correctly you're good to go! 
If the library is not installed properly you will probably get errors mentioning "symbol not found".
In this case make sure you have unzipped the library correctly.
