Welcome to the DIY Gamer Arduino library

This library enables you to easily control the DIY Gamer kit
and make awesome minimal games, pixel by pixel.

INSTALLING
==========

1. Use the Download ZIP button to grab the Gamer and Tone libraries.
2. Unzip the contents into your Arduino libraries folder (Documents/Arduino/libraries on OSX, My Documents\Arduino\libraries on Windows or ~/Documents/Arduino/libraries (or similar) on Linux)

TESTING
=======

The easiest way to test is the libraries have been successfully installed for Arduino
run one of the samples for each library(Tone and Gamer). Use the Verify button in Arduino
to compile the example. If it compiles correctly you're good to go! 
If the library is not installed properly you will probably get errors mentioning "symbol not found".
In this case make sure you have unzipped the libraries correctly.
For example, if you haven't installed any other Arduino library 
Documents/Arduino/libraries you should contain two folders: Gamer and Tone
